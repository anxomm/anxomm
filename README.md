### Hi there! I'm Ángel Miguélez 👋

💻📚 I am a graduate student in computer science specialized mainly in artificial intelligence focused on the field of computer vision. Currently, I am fully immersed in the field of artificial intelligence and deep learning applied to e-commerce at Inditex. From computer vision to natural language processing, I am interested in the whole field of deep learning! During my educational stage I have been involved in many types of projects and learned many tools:

- 🔬 Python, Tensorflow/Keras and PyTorch in multiple AI applications: text analysis, image classification and segmentation, numerical predictions, text generation...
- 📈 Julia and Scikit-Learn for time series forecasting (stock market), and River for training models incrementally.
- 🏠 Pentaho and MySQL for data processing and creation of data warehouses, and Tableau for subsequent visualization and analysis.
- 👓 OpenCV for image processing, recognition and correction.
- ⚙️ Clingo for automatic game solvers.
- 📜 Java and Lucene for information retrieval and evaluation of document rankings.

🎮 In my spare time I have also developed some video games in PyGame, libGDX, and Unity, as well as mobile applications with Flutter.
